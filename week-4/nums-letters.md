Ruby Code:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> puts 24*365
8760
=> nil
irb(main):002:0> 60*24*365*10
=> 5256000
```

• **How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

Arithmetic is very simple using Ruby. Writes one of the following arithmetic symbols (or operators) in between two variables (operands).
+ is used for addition
 - is used for subtraction
*  is used for multiplication
/ is used for division
% is used for modulus

• **What is the difference between integers and floats?**

Integers are numbers without decimals. Floats are numbers with decimals.

• **What is the difference between integer and float division?**

Integer division returns a number without decimals. Float division returns numbers with decimals. 

Integer division answers always round down to the nearest whole number, or a number without fractions. 7 divided by 2 expressed as an integer would be 3 instead of 3.5. This would be useful for counting things that cannot be divided, such as toothbrushes. How many $2 toothbrushes can one buy with $7? 7/2 is 3.5, but one cannot buy half a toothbrush, so the correct answer is simply 3.

Float division is more useful  academic experiments that involve for statistics or physics. It also has video and audio implementations.

• **What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings can be used to assign values to a variable. One should use strings so as to save time and do less work. Instead of typing a value over and over, one can assign the value to a string variable and store it for later use.

• **What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

In Ruby, local variables begin with a lower case letter or _. Local variables are only visible in a limited part of a program, such as in a method definition. 

• **How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

This challenge was quite confusing to me. It felt quite different from the approach to learning Ruby that was taken on CodeAcademy. It took me longer to complete than anticipated, and, even though I was able to get the code to run without errors, I'm not really sure that I grasped the material fully (even though I read the book chapters and online material).

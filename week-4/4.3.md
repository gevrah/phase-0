• **How do you define a local variable?**

One simply choose a name for the variable, then sets it equal to whatever one wants the variable to be. That is,
local_variable = "this is a local variable"

• **How do you define a method?**
In order to define a method, one must simply time.
def method(my_argument) 
method
end

• **What is the difference between a local variable and a method?**
Just as every verb needs a noun, every method in Ruby needs an object. i.e. object.method. Every single object in Ruby is being manipulated by a method.

• **How do you run a ruby program from the command line?**

In the command line, just ruby followed by the name of the Ruby file one is going to use. That is,

ruby file_name.rb 


• **How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?**

In the command line, just type rspec followed by the name of the spec file one us going to use. That is,

rspec spec-file-name.rb


• **What was confusing about this material? What made sense?**

I was much less confused than the previous section and things are beginning to click. Basically everything made sense without too much difficulty.

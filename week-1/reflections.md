# **1.1 Think About Time Reflection**
	
	• **Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**
		○ I learned about:
			§ Pomodoro Technique
				□ 25 minutes working, 5 minutes break
			§ Mindfulness Meditation and its effect on productivity
				□ Downloaded meditation app to meditate each night in hopes of increasing my level of focus. I also hope to improve my concentration, anxiety levels, sleep, creativity, empathy, memory retention, and the ability to control my emotions.
			§ The Growth Mindset - taking failure in stride and using it to grow.
				□ Growth mindset sees the self as ever changing and able to improve. Takes failure as an opportunity to learn.
				□ Fixed mindset sees the self as static. Failure proves one's worthlessness, and derails the self.
			§ Being perseverant is key to being productive. If I lose focus, I will continually work to regain focus on the task at hand.
			§ I learned to start small and gradually build up in order to be productive. Don't delay, get the bare minimum that meets requirements (or demand) done and then add complexity if have extra time. 
			§ Create good productivity habits by using situational triggers. It's important for the habit to be specific and simple. Example: 10 pushups after flushing the toilet.
			§ It's important to enter an uninterrupted flow state in order to be productive, 9 elements of flow:
				□ Clear goals
				□ Immediate feedback to one's actions
				□ Balance between challenge and skill
				□ Action and awareness are merged
				□ Distractions are excluded form consciousness
				□ No fear of failure
				□ Self-consciousness disappears
				□ Sense of time is distorted
				□ Things become done for the end goal of the pleasure they give for doing them
			§ It's important to relax one's eyes, use breath and posture to stay focused.
	
	• **What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**
		○ Time boxing is the same as the Pomodoro Technique. It includes using a timer to count 25 minutes of concentrated work, and then 5 minutes of relaxation. Time boxes are a good way to use the brain's natural ebb and flow to be more productive. I will use time boxes while in Dev Bootcamp in order to use my time more efficiently, instead of forcing myself to study non-stop.
	
	• **How do you manage your time currently?**
		○ I use the Google Calendar for important due dates and Evernote for Tasks. I've been a procrastinator in the past, but the habit of using my calendar and task apps have helped me greatly. I've been doing this for a few years now, and reading the same recommendations in the 1.1 section of Dev Bootcamp reinforced these habits.
	
	• **Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**
		○ It's working in fairly well. It took quite a bit of willpower to force myself to develop the habit of adding items to my calendar and task lists, though my desire to be accountable has helped me in forcing myself to do this. 
	
	• **Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**
		○ I have already begun employing all of the useful tips and tricks I learned in this lesson. It's already made me more productive, and so I will keep forcing myself to keep doing what I've learned. The one thing I need is a kitchen timer so as to use the Pomodoro technique (a phone timer app just distracts me). I'm also going to follow guided mindful meditation through an app before going to sleep each night.
	
	• **What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**
		○ I am going to work during the time of day in which I'm most productive (afternoons/evenings). I will turn off all notifications on my phone and computer and enter a state of flow as I chip away at my work. I will be sure to perform mindful meditation before going to sleep, and to get enough hours of sleep so that my mind is fresh each day. Using the information that I've learned, I will continually work towards gaining new good habits so as to set myself up for success.


# **1.2 The Command Line Reflection**

	• **What is a shell? What is "bash?**
		○ A shell is an approachable way for interacting with the raw horsepower of a computer, a command language that does not have a Graphic User Interface.
		○ Bash is a Unix shell command language that we learned about in this lesson. It is the default on Linux and OS X.
	 
	• **What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**
		○ It was challenging to learn to navigate through folders, I kept getting lost. That was very momentary though, as the more I practiced, the easier it came to me. At first I was a bit bewildered and kept getting errors while trying to open folders. I quickly figured out how to use pwd to see where I was, and ../ to navigate up, and ls to see what folders were available for me to navigate to using ls.
	
	• **Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**
		○ I was successful in using all of the commands. The instructions in the Bash Crash Course were very straightforward, and I was able to learn the commands quickly. It was even fun to repeat the exercises and create my own folders and files, to move input from one file to another, and to erase files and folders (among other things).
	
	• **In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**
		○ It seems to me that it's important to understand the use of all commands and arguments, as they work in conjunction with each other. 
	
	• **Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**
		-pwd
			Print working directory
		-ls
			List directory
		-mv
			Move file or directory
		-cd 
			Change directory
		-../
			When used in conjunction with cd, .. can be used to move up in the tree and path
		-touch
			Creates an empty file
		-mkdir
			Make directory
		-less
			Page through a file
		-rmdir
			Remove directory
		-rm
			Remove a file
		-help
			Read a manual page


# **1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection**
	
	• **If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**
		• **How to Create a Repo:**
			○ This is fairly simple. Simply navigate to your Github profile, click on the + sign on the top right corner next to your profile, and select "New Repository." It'll be necessary to name the repository, as well as choose whether to make it public or private.
		• **How to Fork a Repo:**
			○ On your web browser, first navigate to the Github repository which you wish to fork (e.g.:  https://github.com/Devbootcamp/p0-cli-exploration
			○ On the top right of the screen, below your profile icon, simply press the Fork button. It's that simple!
		• **How to Clone a Repo:**
			○ Navigate to the Repo that you'd like to clone on Github and copy the https url that's provided.
			○ On your computer, open a command line terminal. Now navigate to the folder in which you're keeping your project files.
			○ Simply type the following in your terminal (not including the $): $git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED
		• **Why Fork a repository instead of create a new one?**
			○ Forking a repo allows one to freely experiment with an existing repo, without having to start from scratch. Forking is a good way to edit an existing project, or to gain a head start on your own.
	
	• **What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**
		• The instructions were clear and I did not run into any problems while setting up Git or Github. Since I had my mac set up correctly, I didn't run into any errors. I did learn quite a lot about the way that developers collaborate on software across the globe, which is fascinating to me. I'm excited to begin managing version control on a project with my cohort!

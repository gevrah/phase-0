// As a user, I'm in need of three functions that determine the sum, mean, and median of the numbers from two lists. 
// One list will be of odd length and one will be of even length.

// 	1. Sum Function:
// 		a. Inputting a list of numbers of odd length into this function will return a sum of all values from this list.
// 		b. Inputting a list of numbers of even length into this same function will also return a sum of all values from this list.
// 	2. Mean Function:
// 		a. Inputting a list of numbers of odd length will return the mean/average of the numbers in this list.
// 		b. Inputting a list of numbers of even length will return the mean/average of the numbers in this list.
// 	3. Median Function:
// 		a. Inputting a list of numbers of odd length will return the median value of the numbers in this list.
// 		b. Inputting a list of numbers of even length will return the median value of the numbers in this list.

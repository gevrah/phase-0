• **How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

Chrome DevTools allows users to (right-click) inspect the raw HTML and CSS of any given webpage. If I'm trying to get the layout right on any given webpage, I can use the inspector to change the CSS code of said webpage and see the changes live. In addition, if I see a webpage's layout that I like, I can inspect the elements of said site in order to implement that layout in my own webpage's CSS code.

• **How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

Utilizing CSS, it is possible to resize elements using DOM by using the Height and Width property. One would target code with a selector and specify the height and width in pixels. Alternatively, the height and width can be measured as a % or an "em". If a developer wants to limit the size of an element to a proportion of the page, this can be done with max-width and max-height.
	Examples:
		○ width: 45%
		○ Height: 5 em
		○ Max-width: 45%

• **What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**
	• Static: the default position of elements and does not need to be specified with CSS.
	
	• Relative: will position an element relative to its normal flow. It is still within the normal html parent/sibling relative relationship.
	
	• Fixed: this takes the element out of normal flow and is a type of absolute positioning that is relative to the browser window.
	
	• Absolute: this takes the element out of normal flow and no longer affects other elements within the normal flow.

• **What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

	• Within the Box Model:
	
		○ Margin is the exterior part of the box, and it clears space around an element's border and is transparent.
		
		○ Border goes around the padding of an element and defines its edge.
		
		○ Padding the layer that is directly around the content and is transparent.
		
• **What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**
	•The challenge struck the right balance between challenging and fun. I had quite a bit of confusion over positioning, and this extra practice really helped me understand it better. I did have to do quite a bit of outside reading to better understand positioning, but this exercise solidified my learning.

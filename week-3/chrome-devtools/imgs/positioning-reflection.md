• How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

	Chrome DevTools allows users to (right-click) inspect the raw HTML and CSS of any given webpage. If I'm trying to get the layout right on any given webpage, I can use the inspector to change the CSS code of said webpage and see the changes live. In addition, if I see a webpage's layout that I like, I can inspect the elements of said site in order to implement that layout in my own webpage's CSS code.

• How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	Utilizing CSS, it is possible to resize elements using DOM by using the Height and Width property. One would target code with a selector and specify the height and width in pixels. Alternatively, the height and width can be measured as a % or an "em". If a developer wants to limit the size of an element to a proportion of the page, this can be done with max-width and max-height.
	Examples:
		○ width: 45%
		○ Height: 5 em
		○ Max-width: 45%

• What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
	• Static: the default position of elements and does not need to be specified with CSS.
	• Relative: will position an element relative to its normal flow. It is still within the normal html parent/sibling relative relationship.
	• Fixed: this takes the element out of normal flow and is a type of absolute positioning that is relative to the browser window.
	• Absolute: this takes the element out of normal flow and no longer affects other elements within the normal flow.

• What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	• Within the Box Model:
		○ Margin is the exterior part of the box, and it clears space around an element's border and is transparent.
		○ Border goes around the padding of an element and defines its edge.
		○ Padding the layer that is directly around the content and is transparent.
• What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	•The challenge struck the right balance between challenging and fun. I had quite a bit of confusion over positioning, and this extra practice really helped me understand it better. I did have to do quite a bit of outside reading to better understand positioning, but this exercise solidified my learning.

              <span class="question"> What are the benefits of Version Control?</span> 
                Version control allows users to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. One way to use version control is through GitHub, a web based version control and source code management system. Since version control allows each individual user to work on their own iteration of the file, it makes collaboration far easier. It also allows for quality control, since potential changes to the master file are peer-reviewed before they are merged. In addition, version control lets teams see each individual change in a log history, and it is possible to revert back to any revision in case of an error. This makes experimenting with new features for a program far less risky. Finally, version control acts as a back-up for your files, since a full version of any given file is saved on the web.

              <span class="question">How does git help you keep track of changes?</span>
                Git allows developers to track and control the changes made by various individual users to files. Git allows users to convert local folders to git repositories, which are version controlled folders. This allows users to access past versions for reference, and roll back previous commits, which are save points in git. Each commit has:
            </p>
                <ul class="commit">
                  <li>A unique id that is a string of numbers and letters.</li>
                  <li>A message that details the change made in the save point. This should be specific.</li>
                  <li>The author of the commit.</li>
                  <li>A timestamp. This helps in dealing with bugs.</li>
                </ul>

              <span class="question">Why use GitHub to store your code?</span>
              While GitHub has certain shortcomings, such as requiring payment in order to store private repositories, it's among the best free alternatives for Open Source projects. GitHub is the most popular version control management system, and this makes it easy to get feedback on your projects. In addition, due to its popularity and very active community, GitHub also has a very thorough help section and even guides for whatever Git issue one might be having difficulties with.

• What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	• <head>: this is used to provide metadata about the webpage
		○ <title>: this is the title of the page used in search engine results and the browser toolbar, and in favorites.
		○ <meta>: provides additional information about the content of the body.
	• <body>: all the contents of an html document.
		○ <main>: this is the main content of a document and there should be only one per.
		○ <article>: this contains all the main contents of a document and should be able to stand on its own. There can be more than one per page
		○ <header>: the intro to a document, with an <h1-h6> within it.
		○ <section>: chapters, headers, footers within the body.
		○ <nav>: this can be used to create navigation bars to other parts of a webpage.
		○ <aside>: this is information not directly relevant to the main part of the document, such as ads.
		○ <footer>: this is for the bottom of the page and can contain contact info, related pages, copyright info, etc.

• How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	• Elements get laid out according to their place within the HTML structure. An HTML document has two separate branches, the head and the body. The body has parent elements and child elements. The browser will position elements based on the order in which they are placed within the HTML document (unless CSS is used to position elements).

• What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

In this challenge I learned about snippets. They're easy to make shortcuts that can be used to automatically fill in code that one often types in. It's a great way to save time. I'll most definitely be creating new snippets as I spend more time coding - especially once I'm coding full time, since I'll benefit from every bit of efficiency I can gain. A quick search led me to this site full of CSS snippet links: http://www.awwwards.com/best-css-code-snippets-sites.html

<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  *It was so fun! I was able to solidfy my understanding of the HTML tags I learned by having to figure out which tags to use to replicate the Berkshire site. It really was not so tough as I thought it would be.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  *It was enjoyable and fairly straight forward. We avoided table hell and will use CSS to divide the information of the site. Tables should only be used for tabular data. We used div in order to divide the logical groupings of the page (the title/location info, the links, the ad, and the legal disclaimer). We did not use divs as headings or to make lists. Since semantics helps websites with SEO, we tried to use as many as were relevant, such athe <h1> tag.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  *We did very well! My group-mate was using the H3 tag to make the title smaller, and I had to make sure to tell her that should be done with CSS. A few times it was tempting to use CSS, though we focused on just developing the structure of the site through HTML, realizing that it's more efficient in the end.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  *HTML is an excellent tool to develop the structure of webpages for web browsers to read. The only issue I think is that it's very tempting to ignore semantics to develop sites that are easily readable by those who can see and to leave the visually impaired by the wayside. Even though it's not intuitively important, it's essential to use semantics not just to help the visually impaired, but to help computers read our content and improve the search enginge rankings of our sites.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  *One of my tricks is to remember that for most every tag I open, I also have to close it. Thankfully, Sublime Text does this for me automatically. Another great trick: if I can't remember how to do something, Google is my friend! So far I've been able to get unstuck by googling my way out of every problem I could not figure out on my own. An even better trick (that was not used in this challenge) is to view the source code of websites that have elements that I want to copy.

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
	# The most interesting and difficult part of this challenge was figuring out
	# how to input an excel column/row list into Ruby, so as not to have to write
	# out each individual string. This didn't really save me any time, but it was fun to learn.
# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
	# Yes, I'm getting better at it. I did GPS 2.2 early in the week, and it kicked my ass.
	# this, not so much.
# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
	# My approach is simple and it worked pretty much on the first try. I'm happy with it.
# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
	# I chose an array, as this was the most straight-forward, easy way to get it done.
# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
	# I added a .shuffle method to my solution, which scrambled the groups so that they
	# would not be divided by alphabetical order.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# For the first, I used .select and .include. I ran into difficulty with .include, which would not accept 
# integers as arguments. It took me too long to figure out that I could just add .to_s before
# .include in order to resolve that issue.
# For the second, I used .select to create a new array. This one was very straightforward. Had to add .keys at end
# so only keys would be returned.
